# Ainsley Owens' Webpage

This is a page where I will share some information about myself and the work that I am doing in BioStatistics/BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I also have done some work to analyze data on Squirrels.

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. I ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can view my analysis [here](https://ainsleyowens.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html).
# Work with Squirrels
I then continued learning how to use R by working with the NYC Squirrels Census data set. I ran an analysis on 2,373 squirrels. If you are interested, you can view my analysis [here](https://ainsleyowens.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/SquirrelAnalysis.html).

## Work with Genomes

I furthered my knowledge and skills with R by working through three notebooks, analyzing genomes and DNA sequences. The ultimate goal of this project was to find the replication origin of a DNA genome. During DNA replication, proteins must locate the origin where the process begins. I learned several new coding methods and tools. Including but not limited to creating lists and sample genomes with the c() and sample() functions, as well as using the set.seed() function to set a seed for random number generation to ensure reproducible results. I also learned how to create for loops, and if/else statements to ensure the code is only ran when specific criteria are met. I learned how to scan in datasets, and correctly solve bioinformatics problems on the Rosalind problem. Additionally, I learned how to use functions to write reusable code and count the number of occurrences of patterns in a list, or genome in this case. These tools and functions all brought me closer to finding the replication origin of a genome, although future work is still required.
If you are interested in viewing these notebooks, they can be found [here](https://github.com/agmath/BIO4ST1_Group3/blob/1dca2dd92c0ea98b4c2ad5dd6e79cd4e91d7157e/Replication_Ainsley_Owens.qmd).
