# Ainsley Owens' Webpage

This is a page where I will share some information about myself and the work that I am doing in BioStatistics/BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I also have done some work to analyze data on Squirrels.

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. I ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can view my analysis [here](https://github.com/ainsleyowens/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html)
