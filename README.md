# Ainsley Owens' Webpage

I am a graduating Biology major at Southern New Hampshire University. This semester, I did some work with BioStatistics/BioInformatics, using RStudio. This is a page where I will share some information about myself and the work that I am doing. So far, I've done some work to analyze data on Penguins, and I also have done some work to analyze data on Squirrels. I completed multiple notebooks working with DNA genomes and the replication origin. This work can all be accessed and viewed through this webpage. 

## About Me

I am a senior at Southern New Hampshire University, graduating with my Bachelor of Science in Biology. Throughout my time at SNHU, my main interest and academic focus has been Human Biology. Post-graduation, I am looking to work in the medical field. Prior to taking this BioInformatics course, I did not have any previous experience with coding, BioStatistics, or RStudio. I am hopeful that the skills and knowledge I attained from this course will be beneficial in my future career.

## Work with Penguins

I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. During this project, I learned and practiced the basics of R. I ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can view my analysis [here](https://ainsleyowens.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguinsAnalysis.html).
# Work with Squirrels
I then continued learning how to use R by working with the NYC Squirrels Census data set. I ran an analysis on 2,373 squirrels. If you are interested, you can view my analysis [here](https://ainsleyowens.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/SquirrelAnalysis.html).

## Work with Genomes

I furthered my knowledge and skills with R by working through three notebooks, analyzing genomes and DNA sequences. The ultimate goal of this project was to find the replication origin of a DNA genome. During DNA replication, proteins must locate the origin where the process begins. I learned several new coding methods and tools. Including but not limited to creating lists and sample genomes with the c() and sample() functions, as well as using the set.seed() function to set a seed for random number generation to ensure reproducible results. I also learned how to create for loops, and if/else statements to ensure the code is only ran when specific criteria are met. I learned how to scan in datasets, and correctly solve bioinformatics problems on the Rosalind problem. Additionally, I learned how to use functions to write reusable code and count the number of occurrences of patterns in a list, or genome in this case. These tools and functions all brought me closer to finding the replication origin of a genome, although future work is still required.
